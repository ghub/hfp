Chapter 1. Meet Python: Everyone loves lists

PYTHON LINGO

    - “BIF” - a built-in function.
    - “Suite” - a block of Python code, which is indented to indicate
      grouping.

IDLE NOTES

    - The IDLE shell lets you experiment with your code as you write it.
    - Adjust IDLE’s preferences to suit the way you work.
    - Remember: when working with the shell, use Alt-P for Previous and
      use Alt-N for Next (but use Ctrl if you’re on a Mac).

BULLET POINTS

    - “Batteries included” - a way of referring to the fact that Python
      comes with most everything you’ll need to get going quickly and
      productively.
    - Run Python 3 from the command line or from within IDLE.
    - Identifiers are names that refer to data objects. The identifiers
      have no “type,” but the data objects that they refer to do.
    - print() BIF displays a message on screen.
    - A list is a collection of data, separated by commas and surrounded
      by square brackets.
    - Lists are like arrays on steroids.
    - Lists can be used with BIFs, but also support a bunch of list
      methods.
    - Lists can hold any data, and the data can be of mixed type. Lists
      can also hold other lists.
    - Lists shrink and grow as needed. All of the memory used by your
      data is managed by Python for you.
    - Python uses indentation to group statements together.
    - len() BIF provides a length of some data object or count the
      number of items in a collection, such as a list.
    - The for loop lets you iterate a list and is often more convenient
      to use that an equivalent while loop.
    - The if... else... statement lets you make decisions in your code.
    - isinstance() BIF checks whether an identifier refers to a data
      object of some specified type.
    - Use def to define a custom function.
