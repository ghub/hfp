Chapter 1. Meet Python: Everyone loves lists

PYTHON LINGO

    - “BIF” - a built-in function.
    - “Suite” - a block of Python code, which is indented to indicate
      grouping.

IDLE NOTES

    - The IDLE shell lets you experiment with your code as you write it.
    - Adjust IDLE’s preferences to suit the way you work.
    - Remember: when working with the shell, use Alt-P for Previous and
      use Alt-N for Next (but use Ctrl if you’re on a Mac).

BULLET POINTS

    - “Batteries included” - a way of referring to the fact that Python
      comes with most everything you’ll need to get going quickly and
      productively.
    - Run Python 3 from the command line or from within IDLE.
    - Identifiers are names that refer to data objects. The identifiers
      have no “type,” but the data objects that they refer to do.
    - print() BIF displays a message on screen.
    - A list is a collection of data, separated by commas and surrounded
      by square brackets.
    - Lists are like arrays on steroids.
    - Lists can be used with BIFs, but also support a bunch of list
      methods.
    - Lists can hold any data, and the data can be of mixed type. Lists
      can also hold other lists.
    - Lists shrink and grow as needed. All of the memory used by your
      data is managed by Python for you.
    - Python uses indentation to group statements together.
    - len() BIF provides a length of some data object or count the
      number of items in a collection, such as a list.
    - The for loop lets you iterate a list and is often more convenient
      to use that an equivalent while loop.
    - The if... else... statement lets you make decisions in your code.
    - isinstance() BIF checks whether an identifier refers to a data
      object of some specified type.
    - Use def to define a custom function.

Chapter 2. Sharing your Code: Modules of functions

PYTHON LINGO

    - Use a “triple-quoted string” to include a multiple-line comment in your
      code.
    - “PyPI” is the Python Package Index and is well worth a visit.
    - A “namespace” is a place in Python’s memory where names exist.
    - Python’s main namespace is known as __main__.

IDLE NOTES

    - Press F5 to “run” the code in the IDLE edit window.
    - When you press F5 to “load” a module’s code into the IDLE shell, the
      module’s names are specifically imported into IDLE’s namespace. This is a
      convenience when using IDLE. Within your code, you need to use the import
      statement explicitly.

BULLET POINTS

    - A module is a text file that contains Python code.
    - The distribution utilities let you turn your module into a shareable
      package.
    - The setup.py program provides metadata about your module and is used to
      build, install, and upload your packaged distribution.
    - Import your module into other programs using the import statement.
    - Each module in Python provides its own namespace, and the namespace name
      is used to qualify the module’s functions when invoking them using the
      module.function() form.
    - Specifically import a function from a module into the current namespace
      using the from module import function form of the import statement.
    - Use # to comment-out a line of code or to add a short, one-line comment
      to your program.
    - The built-in functions (BIFs) have their own namespace called
      __builtins__, which is automatically included in every Python program.
    - The range() BIF can be used with for to iterate a fixed number of times.
    - Including end='' as a argument to the print() BIF switches off its
      automatic inclusion of a new-line on output.
    - Arguments to your functions are optional if you provide them with a
      default value.

Chapter 3. Files and Exceptions: Dealing with errors

PYTHON LINGO

    - An “exception” occurs as a result of a runtime error, producing a
      traceback.
    - A “traceback” is a detailed description of the runtime error that has
      occurred.

IDLE NOTES

    - Access Python’s documentation by choosing Python Docs from IDLE’s Help
      menu. The Python 3 documentation set should open in your favorite web
      browser.

BULLET POINTS

    - Use the open() BIF to open a disk file, creating an iterator that reads
      data from the file one line at a time.
    - The readline() method reads a single line from an opened file.
    - The seek() method can be used to “rewind” a file to the beginning.
    - The close() method closes a previously opened file.
    - The split() method can break a string into a list of parts.
    - An unchangeable, constant list in Python is called a tuple. Once list
      data is assigned to a tuple, it cannot be changed. Tuples are immutable.
    - A ValueError occurs when your data does not conform to an expected
      format.
    - An IOError occurs when your data cannot be accessed properly (e.g.,
      perhaps your data file has been moved or renamed).
    - The help() BIF provides access to Python’s documentation within the IDLE
      shell.
    - The find() method locates a specific substring within another string.
    - The not keyword negates a condition.
    - The try/except statement provides an exception-handling mechanism,
      allowing you to protect lines of code that might result in a runtime
      error.
    - The pass statement is Python’s empty or null statement; it does nothing.
